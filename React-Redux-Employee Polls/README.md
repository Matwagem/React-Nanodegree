# Would you rather - a way to create polls!
V1.0

'Would you rather' is a React application, using Redux to manage state. It has been built as part of the Udacity React Development Nanodegree. You can log in as various users using the dropdown provided, after which you receive an overview of answered/unanswered polls. You can also check out the leaderboard, or add a new poll yourself! 404 pages are taken into account, as well as trying to access polls that do not exist. Finally, 10 unit tests were written using JEST to check whether functions are behaving accordingly. 

## Installation
